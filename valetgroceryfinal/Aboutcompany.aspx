                      The Valet Grocery was founded on the idea that grocery shopping can be both convenient and cost effective.  Most people rank grocery shopping near the top of their list of most dreaded household chores.  With today's busy lifestyles shoppers have difficulty finding a convenient time to go to the grocery store.  Others may have physical limitations which make it nearly impossible to shop for the groceries they need each week.  The Valet Grocery can provide you with top quality local groceries and deliver them to your door without breaking your budget.  When you factor in the time you must take out of your busy day and the rising cost per gallon of gas, we think you will find that you actually come out ahead by ordering your groceries online at The Valet Grocery and having them delivered to your door at a time that is convenient for you.  We only charge $5 to deliver to your door, but if you purchase $100 or more we will deliver it to you absolutely FREE!

                      While shopping for groceries online may be a new experience, you will find it easy to browse through our aisles to find the items you need.  All of the items are clearly marked with sizes, descriptions, and prices.  You will be able to see exactly how much you are spending as you shop so you can stay within your budget.  On your first visit with us, we suggest that you set up your Account Profile and then leisurely browse through all of the aisles, choosing items that you usually buy at one time or another.  Then save this list as your master list.  You will be able to shop from this list every week by adding or subtracting items as needed.  If you don't see an item that you normally buy, click on the icon that says <a href="SuggestProduct.aspx" class="Userlink1">Suggest a Product</a> and enter the details (brand, size, flavor, etc.).
