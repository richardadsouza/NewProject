                            <li><strong>The Valet Grocery's Delivery Service and Website.</strong> The Valet Grocery
                                service is a transaction, information and communication service available to authorized
                                users ("customers") who access valetgrocery.com. The Valet Grocery currently
                                provides an online grocery shopping and delivery service, and may in the future
                                provide additional shopping and related services.<br />
                                <br />

                                    <li><strong>Grocery Shopping and Delivery Service.</strong> The Valet Grocery's employees,
                                        agents or designees will shop and deliver grocery orders placed with The Pantry
                                        Filler. Delivery will be made to the delivery address that you specify when you
                                        place your order. Payment for groceries and associated shopping and delivery fees
                                        is due at the time the order is placed. You are responsible for ensuring that someone
                                        is present at the delivery address to receive deliveries at the specified time of
                                        delivery. Anyone at the delivery address who receives the delivery is conclusively
                                        presumed to be authorized to receive the order. If The Valet Grocery cannot deliver
                                        your order, or must make an additional delivery because no one is at the delivery
                                        address to receive and pay for the order at the specified time, you will be assessed
                                        an additional fee. If you are not satisfied for any reason with an item purchased
                                        through The Valet Grocery, you may return it and it will be credited against your
                                        next Valet Grocery order. If an item you choose is not in inventory, we reserve
                                        the right to replace the item with an equivalent product. We will adjust the price
                                        if the product is less, but we will not charge more if the product is more. The
                                        Valet Grocery's liability for missing a delivery or pickup time is limited to delivery
                                        at a later agreed time at no additional charge.</strong> </li>
